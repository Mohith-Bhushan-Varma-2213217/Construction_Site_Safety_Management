# Construction Site Safety Management Project using YOLO models
## Introduction:
The focus on safety helmet detection aligns with the broader goal of creating safer working environments. Implementing image processing techniques, particularly DL, facilitates real-time monitoring of safety helmet presence on construction site personnel. 
This research contributes to the evolving landscape of image processing, employing various DL technologies and target detection algorithms.
As industries increasingly embrace AI solutions, the integration of safety helmet detection exemplifies the practical applications of AI in mitigating workplace risks and promoting a safer work environment.

## Dataset Overview:
The Dataset that we have chosen for this project is Construction Site Safety Image Dataset from Roboflow Website link here [roboflow.com](https://universe.roboflow.com/roboflow-universe-projects/construction-site-safety/dataset/27/download/yolov8) the whole website is a largest collection of open source computer vision datasets and APIs. We navigated to the universe tab present in the website, Roboflow universe projects and then searched for the Construction Site Safety Dataset. There are 717 images with different scenarios with respect to construction site and the generic figures. Here are some of the use cases for this dataset and the project.

+ Compliance Monitoring:
  The Construction Site Safety model can be used by construction site managers, safety officers, or regulatory agencies to monitor and ensure that workers are adhering to safety protocols, such as wearing appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE).
+ Accident Detection and Prevention: The model can be integrated with surveillance or monitoring systems on construction sites to detect potentially hazardous situations, such as a person not wearing a hardhat or safety vest near heavy machinery, allowing for real-time intervention and accident prevention.
+ Construction Site Access Control: The model can be employed at entry and exit points of construction sites to identify and grant access only to authorized personnel wearing the proper safety gear, helping to maintain a safe working environment and prevent unauthorized access. There are 10 different popular download formats of the image dataset, in this, we have chosen YOLOv7 and YOLOv8 for this project.
